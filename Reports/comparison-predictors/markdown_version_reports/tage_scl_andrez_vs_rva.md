# tage_scl_andrez_vs_rva.md 

- this one i was the most excited for because this was the one that essentially did data driven predictions vs history based prediction and as i predicted the data driven based prediction won ie rva-toru won. 

Data Quality:
  Valid traces:   104
  Skipped traces: 1 (zero MPKI)

Delta Statistics (Δ = MPKI_RVA-Toru - MPKI_TAGE-SCL):
  Average:  -0.1393 MPKI
  Std Dev:  0.4437 MPKI
  Median:   -0.0298 MPKI

Improvement Analysis:
  TAGE-SCL beats RVA-Toru: 30/104 traces (28.8%)

Worst-Case MPKI:
  RVA-Toru: 21.6842
  TAGE-SCL: 23.3263

-  its concludable that rva toru is better than the tage-scl finally andrez seznec has been dethroned. again, its prolly the use of registers and their values that worked the best, and again it sits on top of tage whereas the tage andrez is baseically tage + few optimizations.
